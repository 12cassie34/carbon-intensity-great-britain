# Carbon Intensity Great Britain

In this project, you can explore the carbon intensity in Great Britain to gain insights into electricity production patterns. By understanding the carbon intensity of the electricity we use, we can make informed decisions about our energy consumption, contributing to the fight against climate change.

> <b>What is Carbon Intensity?</b><br>
> Carbon intensity measures the cleanliness of our electricity. It indicates the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted to produce a kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity.
